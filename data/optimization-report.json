  "analysis": "CRITICAL: Bot is completely blocked from trading. Log shows 'Low ATR: 0.06% (need 0.25%)' — the strategy has an internal ATR minimum of 0.25% that's way too high for gold 1-minute candles. Gold 1m ATR is typically 0.03-0.10%, so 0.25% would never trigger. Config has minVolatilityPercent at 0.02 but the strategy code likely overrides or miscalculates. Meanwhile, BTC is crashing hard (from $89k to $73k per statista.com), which is a major risk-off signal — gold should be catching safe-haven bids. The researcher confirms high_vol_chop regime with 0.49% hourly ATR and 1.5% 24h range. Current price ~$5041 (gold futures with premium over spot ~$2880). We're in the thin Asian session post-maintenance, but the bot should still be ready to trade. Need to rewrite strategy to fix ATR filter, improve gold-specific logic, and add session awareness.",
