  "analysis": "Gold at $5078 in London session, trending_bullish regime (0.85 confidence). Bot showing HIGH_VOL_CHOP internally despite researcher saying trending_bullish — the internal regime detection may be using stale data. 24h range is 2.1% which is elevated but good for momentum. The bot isn't trading due to stale brief. Key issue: maxTradeSeconds shows 10800 in config but bot banner says 7200s — need to align. Gold surged to $5600 in Jan per [monetary-metals.com](https://www.monetary-metals.com/insights/articles/gold-outlook-report-2026-brief/) before pulling back, now consolidating ~$5080. JPMorgan sees gold potentially breaking $5000 per [jpmorgan.com](https://jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/commodities/gold-prices). We're above that psychological level — bullish bias confirmed. Lowering momentum threshold further and widening profit target to ride the trend.",
