  "analysis": "Gold at $5081 in London session with trending_bullish regime (0.9 confidence), bid-heavy orderbook. Bot is freshly deploying after being blocked. The 24h range is 2.1% which is elevated for gold — good for momentum scalping. Previous optimizer already lowered momentumThreshold to 0.01. I'll widen target profit to capture the trend, extend max hold time since gold trends cleanly, and ensure the bot can actually enter trades aggressively. Per [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/gold-eyes-glittering-milestone-bear-case-also-rises-2025-02-12/) and [morganstanley.com](https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/gold-price-forecast-rally-into-2026), gold's structural bull case remains strong with central bank buying and safe-haven demand.",
