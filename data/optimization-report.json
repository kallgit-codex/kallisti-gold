  "analysis": "Bot has been completely blocked for 1+ hours by TWO issues: (1) Brief staleness check is rejecting briefs even when they're <20min old — threshold too tight or clock skew. (2) Strategy internally classifies as 'high_vol_chop' overriding researcher's 'trending_bullish' signal. Gold at $5,048-5,072 is trending bullish with 1.5% daily range and 0.85 confidence. ATR 0.03-0.06% on 1m candles is NORMAL for gold — per mql5.com, gold respects EMAs and trends cleanly. Per tapbit.com, gold near $4,941-5,000+ area with central bank buying. We need to completely rewrite the strategy to actually trade. Config params also need tuning: lower min volatility, extend brief staleness tolerance, and adjust momentum thresholds for gold's personality.",

(2) Internal 'high_vol_chop' regime classification overrides researcher's regime, also preventing trades. Need to: fix staleness to 30min tolerance, trust researcher regime, remove hardcoded ATR minimums that block gold, implement proper gold momentum + mean reversion hybrid that can actually generate signals at gold's 0.03-0.06% ATR levels.
