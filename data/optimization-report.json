  "analysis": "The bot finally got data and entered a trade, but the stop was only 0.03% ($1.48) — way too tight for gold's 0.05% ATR per minute. It got stopped out immediately for a $5.16 loss. The 'Insufficient data for swing analysis' issue resolved itself. Now I need to fix the actual stop/target levels — the config says 0.3% stop but the trade opened with 0.03%, suggesting the strategy is overriding with ATR-based stops that are too tight. Need to ensure minimum stop distance is adequate and widen targets for the bullish trend.",
