  "analysis": "Bot is finally taking trades but getting stopped out instantly — the 0.25% initialStopPercent is being overridden by ATR-based stops that are absurdly tight (0.02% stop = $0.76 on a $5k position). The ATR filter at 0.03% is barely letting trades through, and when they do, the stops are tighter than the spread. Need to widen stops significantly, lower ATR minimum, and increase hold times. Gold at $5087 is trending bullish per researcher with 2.1% 24h range — we should be capturing this trend with wider stops and longer holds.",
