  "analysis": "Gold at $5115 in trending_bullish regime with 80% WR and solid $14 daily PnL. Current open long from $5116 is flat. The bot is performing well but leaving money on the table — two 'generous-exit' trades captured only $0.53 avg vs $8.03 peak unrealized on one. The key issue is the trailing stop / profit-taking isn't locking in gains when they appear. Orderbook is ask-heavy (-0.18 imbalance) which suggests some resistance overhead, so I'll tighten the BE activation and improve profit capture. Per [ad-hoc-news.de](https://www.ad-hoc-news.de/boerse/ueberblick/gold-s-safe-haven-supercycle-massive-opportunity-or-late-to-the-party/68571494) gold is in a 'powerful momentum-driven upswing' with dips being bought — staying long-biased with better profit management.",
